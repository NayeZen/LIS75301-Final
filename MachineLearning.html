    <blockquote cite="https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/difference-between-ai%EF%BB%BF-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20is%20a%20subset,model%20or%20if%2Dthen%20statements.">

        Machine learning is a subset of AI. The theory is simple, machines take data and ‘learn’ for themselves. It is currently the most promising tool in the AI pool for businesses.
        Machine learning systems can quickly apply knowledge and training from large datasets to excel at facial recognition, speech recognition, object recognition,
        translation, and many other tasks. Machine learning allows a system to learn to recognize patterns on its own and make predictions, contrary to hand-coding a
        software program with specific instructions to complete a task.

        While Deep Blue and DeepMind are both types of AI, Deep Blue was rule-based, dependent on programming — so it
        was not a form of machine learning. DeepMind, on the other hand — beat the world champion in Go by training itself on a large data set of expert moves.

        That is, all machine learning counts as AI, but not all AI counts as machine learning.
