          Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) -based technologies are playing a crucial role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          Experts are using AI/ML to study the virus, test potential treatments, diagnose individuals, analyze the public health impacts, and more.
          Let’s take a deep dive in understanding the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning — the terms which are often used
          interchangeably.

          You can think of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning as a set of a matryoshka doll,
          also known as a Russian nesting doll. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of AI.

          Artificial intelligence is any computer program that does something smart. It can be a stack of a complex
          statistical model or if-then statements. AI can refer to anything from a computer program playing chess, to a voice-recognition system like Alexa. However, the technology can be broadly categorized into three groups — Narrow AI, artificial
          general intelligence (AGI), and superintelligent AI.

          IBM’s Deep Blue, which beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov at the game in 1996, or Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo,
          which beat Lee Sedol at Go in 2016, are examples of narrow AI — AI that is skilled at one specific task.
          This is different from AGI — AGI is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform a range of tasks
          intellectual task that a human being can. On the other hand, Superintelligent AI takes things a step further. As Nick
          Bostrom describes it, this is “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field,
          including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” In other words, it is when the machines have outfoxed us.
