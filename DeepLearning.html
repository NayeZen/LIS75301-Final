    <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/difference-between-ai%EF%BB%BF-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20is%20a%20subset,model%20or%20if%2Dthen%20statements.">

        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Deep artificial neural networks are a set of algorithms reaching new levels of accuracy for many
        important problems, such as image recognition, sound recognition, recommender systems, etc.

        It uses some machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems by tapping into neural
        networks that simulate human decision-making. Deep learning can be costly and requires
        huge datasets to train itself. This is because there are a huge number of parameters that
        need to be understood by a learning algorithm, which can primarily yield a lot of false-positives.
        For example, a deep learning algorithm could be trained to ‘learn’ how a dog looks like. It would
        take an enormous dataset of images for it to understand the minor details that distinguish a dog from a wolf or a fox.

        Deep learning is part of DeepMind’s notorious AlphaGo algorithm,
        which beat the former world champion Lee Sedol in 4 out of 5 games of Go
        using deep learning in early 2016. Google said, “the way the deep learning
        system worked was by combining Monte-Carlo tree search with deep neural networks
        that have been trained by supervised learning, from human expert games, and by reinforcement
        learning from games of self-play.”
